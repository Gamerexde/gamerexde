Hi there, my name is Gamerexde (real name **Samuel**), I am from Puerto Rico.

I like to code *a lot*, my favorite lanugages are C#, Kotlin, Java (as last resort) and Rust. The things I do the most is web development, minecraft modding, or anything that I have interest on learning or making.

I'm currently a Computer Science student.
